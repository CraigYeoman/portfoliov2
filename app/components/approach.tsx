      <h2>My Approach</h2>

      <p>I believe great software starts with asking the right questions. When I encounter a problem, I begin by stepping back to see the full picture. Complexity often hides elegant solutions, so I break challenges down methodically.</p>

      <p>My first question: Has someone solved this before? The answer is almost always yes—or at least something close. I study existing solutions not to copy them, but to understand the patterns that work and adapt them thoughtfully.</p>

      <p>Next, I ask: How can I make this simpler? The best code isn't the cleverest—it's the code that's easiest to understand, maintain, and extend. I ruthlessly eliminate unnecessary complexity.</p>

      <p>Finally: Where does added complexity actually create value? Sometimes a more sophisticated approach delivers measurably better performance or user experience. The key is knowing when that trade-off is worth it.</p>

      <p>In software, everything is a pattern. My job is recognizing which patterns fit, simplifying where I can, and only adding complexity when it truly serves the user.</p>
